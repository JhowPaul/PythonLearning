#Write a Python program to get the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers.


#In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, 
#or smallest common multiple of two integers a and b, usually denoted by lcm(a, b), 
#is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b.
#Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only 
# if a and b are both different from zero. However, some authors define lcm(a,0) as 0 for all a, 
# which is the result of taking the lcm to be the least upper bound in the lattice of divisibility.
